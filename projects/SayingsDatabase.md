<p>
Saying database is a project that I along my pertner created for our ICS 311 homework. The main objective was to create a program that uses a data strucute to organize inputs in a database. The program must also take inputs that are out of the ASCII for languages that contains special symbol like the ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi. The language we decided to use is Hawaiian with translations in English.

<p>
For this project, I worked on the AVL tree which was data strucute we chose to use to implement with our database. The project is programmed using java. I also helped my partner create and debugged the database which stored the sayings. 
</p>
<p>
From this project, I learned how to create a simple database using java. It also exposed me to the problem of not being able to save data once the program is closed. This actually helped me understand the importance of choosing the proper data structures as I encountered many problems trying to implement the wrong structures.

<pre>
How the program works:
  The user can choose from eight different tasks to run. 
  1: Insert Saying : inserts a saying in the database.
  2: Gets the first saying in the database.
  3: Gets the last saying in the database.
  4: Gets the predecessor of the current saying.
  5: Gets the successor of the current saying.
  6: Returns all the Hawaiian sayings that contains the specific word.
  7: Returns all the English translation that contains the specific word.
  8: Exits the program
