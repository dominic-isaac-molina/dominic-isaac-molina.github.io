Secure Texting is project is a homework project that I devopled alone in ICS 311, Fall 2024. This project was orginally assigned to be done in a group of 2-4 people, but since it was the last homework I wanted to do challange myself and do it alone. To comeplete the project, I had to refer a lot to the textbook and other online textbooks for help and clarification. The whole project took about 15-20 hours to complete and received a perfect score.

Secure Texting was my first project where I encountered encryption and decryption. At first I had no idea what encryption was and specially how to implement it. I had to watch multiple Youtube videos just to understand encryption and compression and how to properly implement it. Ths project was written in java using an online java compiler (https://www.jdoodle.com/).

In this project I learned the experience of creating a project with security parameters. From my prior works, security were never really involved as long as the program is running. After working on this project, I was more intrested in cybersecurity and hacking. Working on this project also taught me the importance of file compression not only for space but also for speed and security.
