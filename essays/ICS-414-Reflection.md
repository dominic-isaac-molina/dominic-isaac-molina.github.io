## The Beginning 

In the beginning of the semester, our team had a really strong start. We also had concrete plans and a continuous flow of new ideas for the project. We completed our tasks early, and everyone contributed to the milestones. I would say this early success in planning was due to the meetings we held every weekend, where each group member discussed current progress and any ideas or concerns they had. I honestly loved these meetings, as I got to see where our project was currently sitting. It also allowed me to discuss my ideas and thoughts about the project and ask for any clarification I had with the whole group. I personally used these meetings as a due date to complete certain tasks, which really helped me stay on track and continue to work on the project in a linear flow. 

## The Problems I/We Encountered

Reaching about the halfway mark of the semester, the group decided to stop the weekly meetings due to conflicting schedules between members. I think this became the biggest issue we as a group had. It caused a domino effect that could’ve been preventable if we continued to meet weekly. One of the problems that started due to this issue was the lack of production and addition to the project. I myself am guilty of this, as my contribution greatly declined throughout the semester. I would usually wait until the weekend before the milestones were due before I would do my PR requests, which then led to me usually only finishing one issue instead of the two issues per milestone goal.

Another problem that I encountered was not splitting my issues correctly. I worked on a couple of issues with multiple requirements that could’ve been easily split into two or more issues. This was a problem because it slowed down the PR request, as I would modify a huge number of files that the PR reviewer would need to check one by one to ensure that I did not crash the main branch. Doing multiple things in a single issue also slowed me down because I would add more into the requirement instead of creating new issues every time I encountered new things to add.
