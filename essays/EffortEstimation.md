## Estimate


How I did my estimates is based on how confident I was with tackling the issue. For minor issues like fixing small bugs, I know that the code is already written. I just need to search for the chunk of code and then figure out why it's acting that way. Since I don’t need to write a whole file, I try to be generous by giving myself at least 30 minutes to fix it. But for major issues that require multiple files, I try to give myself hours because I know it will need extensive testing and I need time to research the code. 


## Benefits


I believe there are benefits to estimating ahead because when your overall time spent is compared to the estimated time, you get a gauge on how well you know what you're doing. Let’s say you estimated 30 minutes and ended up working on the issue for 10 minutes. That could suggest that you are better than what you think in implementing or fixing that issue. But on the other hand, if you estimated 1 hour and ended up working on it for 10 hours then that suggests that you should probably get more practice because you don’t know what you’re doing.

I think one of the important benefits of tracking actual effort by separating the effort between coding and research allowed me to see how much time I’m actually spending coding compared to how much time I’m using to research for answers and talking to ChatGPT. For example, from this project I found out that I’m actually spending more time looking for answers online, learning how to implement certain code, and chatting with ChatGPT more than writing code. It allows you to see how efficient your work is because you could be coding for eight hours but is it really eight hours of writing code? Or one hour of writing code, six hours of researching and one hour of staring at your code.


## Counting and Tracking

So throughout the project there were two ways I tracked my time. At the beginning I wasn’t sure if my group wanted to do the extra credit but I still created a spreadsheet to track my time spent. I tracked my time by checking and noting what time I started and and finished. Then I would estimate the time difference between watching Youtube videos and talking to ChatGPT to time spent writing code. About midway through the M2 I installed the presence tool for Visual Studio Code that displays on discord how long you had VSC open. I would use this timer to estimate how much time I’ve been coding then guesstimate the difference between actual coding and research.
