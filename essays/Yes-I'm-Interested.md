## The Spark

My interest in software engineering stems from my high school days when I used to use sneaker bots to purchase limited sneakers. I was always amazed by the bots on how well they performed and adapted to different types of websites. I was so hooked on bots that even without any experience or knowledge with programming, I tried to learn Go so I could create my own bot. My sneaker bot never came to life, but my experience with sneaker botting introduced me to programming and software development. 

## Creating Websites
Web development has been one of my top interests in software engineering. I always dreamed of creating a retail website like Amazon. Out of all the fields in software engineering, I have the most knowledge with web development due to participating in free online courses like The Odin Project. Although I have not yet finished the whole course, it taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. It also pointed out what I need to learn for the future. This includes learning databases like MySQL to store and manage data with. I also need to learn React to create pretty user interfaces. A skill I want to learn soon is cloud computing. I’ve had experience with using cloud from Amazon Web Services and Google cloud, but I have no experience with cloud computing. Since the majority of websites nowadays are run through the cloud, I think this would be a good skill for me to have in the future.

## Securing Applications
An area that I’ve lately gotten interested in is cybersecurity. I am fascinated by how systems can be secured against threats and how vulnerabilities are found by attackers.
I’ve had my first experience with implementing security measures in a project for ICS 311. On the last homework we had to create a simple secured texting program. For this homework I learned about encryption and private keys which I had to implement to tackle security. This sparked my interest in cybersecurity and also had me wondering how secure are individuals when using the web. Currently. I’ve been watching a lot more hacking videos to learn more about hacking and prevention. I’ve never tried hacking and that is a skill I want to learn in the near future. A goal I set for myself is to visit a hackathon this semester to have a first hand experience and witness hackers hack. I also want to see how to create solutions for the bugs that they exploit. 

## Next Up, Working with Data
Another interest that I have yet to experience is data science and analytics. I’ve always loved working with statistics and raw data, which I would say is my favorite aspect in math. Unfortunately, I have not taken any classes that combine software engineering and data. I hope to gain more knowledge in data science and what the work atmosphere is like. I want to learn what they actually do and where the data go after analysis and what they are used for.
