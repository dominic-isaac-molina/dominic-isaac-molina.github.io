## AI in present day

Artificial Intelligence has taken over education just like how it has with many industries like finance and transportation. It's so relevant to the point where UH just introduced its AI chat bot. AI is something that we students could learn to enhance our educational experience as long as the use is not abused.. Especially in software engineering where AI tools are handy to have in one’s arsenal. For ICS 314 I used two AI tools which are ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.

## Reflection on AI usage in ICS 314


### Experience WODs e.g. E18

In all of the homework WODs, I used AI to help me understand code structures and concepts that I have to use to complete the WODS. I also remember using it alot when I had to format things in the CSS when we were working on cloning websites because I couldn’t get things in the Navbar how I wanted them. Overall, I think AI was pretty helpful on the experience WODs because I could ask the questions I had without emailing or waiting for the next in person class. 

### In-class Practice WODs

I don’t remember using any tools in any of the practice, my group and I tried to work on it on our own which helped me get a gauge on what I need to work on for the Thursday WODS. I believed that if I used AI in the practice I’ll end up wasting the practice experience just to get the answer for a non-graded work. This is also the reason why on many practice WODs I wasn’t able to complete the requirement, but I think it helped me see and realize what I don’t understand and need to practice on.

### In-class WODs

I used ChatGPT on all of the In-class WODS because for me, I don’t work well when there's a timer involved. And having AI on the side to explain and help formulate pieces of code, made me confident that I can complete the WODs. I think a drawback is that I don’t think I would be able to complete any WODS without the help of AI. I think I’ve become dependent on it in some way, which is not good since not all courses allow the use of AI.

### Essays

I don’t remember using AI for any of my essays. I just didn’t feel the need for AI especially if I want to write something that is in my feelings and opinion. I think that using AI even for grammar will alternate the mood and vibes that I’m aiming for. For all my essays excluding this, I always ask a friend to proofread my essays for errors. 

### Final project

For the project, I used AI pretty often. It was always handy when I had questions that I needed an answer right away. I also used it to create code snippets to format things like the course list in our project. It was pretty handy when we had to configure the AUTH components for ENV from supabase as there were almost no resources we could use online.  

### Learning a concept / tutorial

I used AI to explain certain concepts that I was confused about, but the majority of the time I would use Youtube since I’m a visual learner and would understand it faster than reading text generated by AI.

### Answering a question in class or in Discord

I don’t remember using AI for any questions in class or discord. I would just answer from what I know or understand. 

### Asking or answering a smart-question

I did not ask nor answered any smart-question in the discord.  

### Coding example 

I don’t remember using AI for code examples.

### Explaining code

For many of the instances I was confused by WOD answers, I would use AI to digest what is going on, this way I understand what each line's purpose is. An example prompt I would use is, “<chunk of code> Explain to me each line and its overall purpose in the program."

### Writing code

There were times where I used AI to create codes for me, especially in the API part of the final project where I was creating the route.ts. For the WODs I remember using AI to generate parts of code for tables in HTML. 

### Documenting code

I didn’t implement comments in my code which is a bad habit, so I did not use AI for documentation purposes.

### Quality assurance e.g. 

I actually used AI for errors that I get on VSC. I would ask what's wrong and how to fix the code for every red underline. For most part, AI was able to explain and fix the error, but there were occasions where it just told me to comment out ESLint which I think is not the best solution. It's more of a quickfix without trying another way.

### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

I think the first 13 questions covered everything that I used AI for in this course.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

For the most part, AI has helped me with a lot of things in this course, ranging from explaining concepts and answering questions I had. I think the use of AI made that what I learned in this class was saved in short term memory and not long term, so I think that's a drawback. Even before I took this class and during the course I tried to draw out my ideas first before coding, this wasn’t something I was able to do in WODs. With that said, I don’t think AI had any effects on my problem solving abilities, other than being a handy tool that I could use when the solution I had in mind needed refinements. I firmly believed that AI made it easier for me to understand software engineering concepts. Although I find it helpful, I think AI makes it harder to retain key concepts that are important from this class.

## Practical Applications:

In my opinion, AI is a tool that can be used in events and activities. But it is nothing more than a tool. It shouldn't be creating and writing the whole project. In many hackathons, If googling for help is allowed then I don’t see why I shouldn't be used. I think that AI with proper prompt is a faster solution than googling things. But there's always the chance of AI generating the wrong answers and that is when the programmer should be able to distinguish if the code or answer is correct or not. AI with proper usage is a powerful tool to help anyone with real world software challenges, but the programmer should understand what belongs in the chat box and not.

## Challenegs and Opportunities 

One instance where AI was completely useless was when my group had a bad commit. I chatted with AI for an hour. It was either I was providing a bad prompt or AI just couldn’t help me. I wasn’t able to get a proper answer and had to ask my professor for help to revert back to the working commit. I think how ICS 314 is handling AI is the best way they could integrate AI. Although it's allowed and students may abuse it, in the end of the course they’ll realize what they have actually learned and how much they’ve relied on AI just in this course alone. 

## Comparative Analysis

As this is my first class where AI use was openly allowed, a difference that I noticed is that this class seems to have no regular quizzes and tests to properly see where the students are, what they know and what do they understand. I also feel in AI-enhanced teaching, retention seems to be worse than traditional. Although harder, I think that traditional is the best way to learn and develop skills rather than AI-enhanced because its similar to having to use your hands compared to having to use a calculator to solve a math problem.

## Future Considerations

I think AI in a software engineering course is actually a good fit because there are too many concepts to learn in a limited time. I think that having AI helps learning concepts easier and faster without having to waste time looking for the right resource. It is also handy when questions arise and there's no time to reach out to professors. A few problems that may occur is AI dependency and abuse. There is also not retaining the key takeaway concepts from this class. I think a way to tackle this is by creating WODS that are AI proof where AI could help but not answer the full thing. I think having quizzes and WODs alternating each week, where WODS are used for coding quizzes and regular quizzes to test concepts would be a good match to see if students are learning what they need to learn.

## Conclusion

AI has been my dear friend in this class, but moving on I realized that I should lessen my dependence on AI. I think that I wasn’t able to fully get or learn what I needed to learn from this class because I had AI as a tool at my disposal. I still think that AI has a place in this class particularly because there are just too many things to learn each week, and there is no way that a student won’t get lost along the way. And I think that’s when AI comes in handy to answer questions when reaching out for help that needs immediate answers. I think for future reference, I strongly agree on having a closebook quiz that will test students on software concepts, because that is the only way to know what the students actually learned from the class.
